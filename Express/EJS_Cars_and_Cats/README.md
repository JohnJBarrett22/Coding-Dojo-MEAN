# EJS Cars and Cats

Repeat the previous assignment, but this time use EJS and include a views directory. 

By telling Express where to find your views directory and that you are using EJS, you will be able to write the following routes in your server:

Have '/cars' show your pictures of cars.

Have '/cats' show your pictures of cats.

Have 'cars/new' show a form to create a new car. The form does not have to do anything yet.

Keep your index.html file in the static directory. It should render even when your server does not explicitly handle the '/' route
