# Assignment: Login and Registration

Create a login and registration that uses back-end validation, catches errors, and displays them to the client.

Required Registration Fields:

* email
* first_name
* last_name
* password
* birthday

Each registration field should have at least one back-end validation on it!

Emails should be unique and valid emails.

How are we going to deal with uniqueness errors? 

The login form should just have fields for password and email.

For this assignment, we recommend that you write all your own code to check for possible errors. 

After you have successfully checked for errors with your own code and passed back error messages to the user, implement mongoose validations.
